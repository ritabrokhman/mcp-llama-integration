MCP Server -LLaMA Integration Framework

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the mcp-llama-integration project! This repository provides a reference implementation for integrating Metaâ€™s LLaMA 3 language model with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework. MCP acts as a universal adapter between large language models (LLMs) and external tools, enabling seamless orchestration of tool usage, context retrieval, and API execution through a standardized JSON-RPC interface.

This integration demonstrates how to:

Connect LLaMA 3 (via Ollama) to an MCP-compliant tool server.
Define and expose tools with structured metadata for LLM invocation.
Handle tool execution, context injection, and response transformation.
Build a scalable, secure, and extensible server architecture for AI agents.
Whether you're building intelligent assistants, automating workflows, or experimenting with tool-augmented LLMs, this project offers a practical foundation for deploying LLaMA in real-world, tool-rich environments.

## **Installation**

To install the MCP Server:

1. Ensure Python 3 is intalled
    Make sure Python 3.1 or higher is installed
    Verify
        **'python --version'**

2. Install FastAPI
    **'pip install fastapi'**

    Ensure FastAPI is up to date 
        **'pip install --upgrade fastapi'**

3. Install Pydantic
    **'pip install pydantic'**

4. Download and start Ollama:
    Download:
        visit: https://ollama.com
        follow the installation instructions for your OS 
    Once installed, pull the model:
       **'ollama pull llama3 '**
    Once pulled run the model:
    **'ollama run llama3.2'**

5. Start the server: 
    **'pipenv run start'**



## **Usage**

Once the MCP server is running, you can interact with it using any client that supports JSON-RPC 2.0. The server listens for requests that invoke tools or retrieve context, and routes them to the appropriate logic handlers.

## **Future Suggestions**
    The mcp-llama-integration project is designed to be a skeleton, enabling a wide range of future applications. Here are some directions this integration can support:
        1. Tool Expansion:
            a. Add new tools to the tools/ directory with custom schemas and execution logic.
            b. Support multi-step toolchains and conditional tool invocation.
            c. Integrate with enterprise APIs, databases, or internal systems.
        2.  Model Flexibility
            a. Swap out LLaMA 3 for other local or hosted models (e.g., Mistral, Claude, GPT-4).
            b. Add support for model selection and fallback strategies.
        3. Agent Frameworks
            a. Wrap the MCP server into a full agent runtime.
